### 1. Introduction
This is a legal agreement between you, the end-user, and the developers of
Quickplay and Quickplay Premium. By using, installing, or purchasing Quickplay,
Quickplay Premium, or any related services or products, you must agree to and
abide by the terms outlined by this agreement.

### 2. Summary
Quickplay uses a custom license due to the inability to find a desired license
which already exists. To save readers some of the trouble of reading through
legal jargon, a summary is provided with key points. The end-user is ALLOWED:
- to use and install Quickplay on their computer.
- to use and install Quickplay Premium on their computer, given they paid the
 non-refundable payment of $5.00 USD or more.
- to transfer their Quickplay Premium service to another account.
- to redistribute exact copies of this software.
- to benignly modify this software for personal or educational use.
- to use portions of this software's code in projects unrelated to Quickplay.
The end-user is NOT ALLOWED:
- to bypass any paywalls within Quickplay or Quickplay Premium.
- to act maliciously with regard to Quickplay or Quickplay Premium.
- to profit off of Quickplay or Quickplay Premium without permission.
- to claim this software as your own.
- to use portions of this software's code in attempt to compete against Quickplay.
- to use any of Quickplay's APIs or software in a way that they are not intended
to be used.
- to violate the law or the rules of the Hypixel Network using Quickplay,
Quickplay Premium, or either's source code.

### 3. Grant of License
This agreement covers both Quickplay and Quickplay Premium. By agreeing to this
agreement, you are granted a limited revocable license to Quickplay and NOT
Quickplay Premium. A license to Quickplay Premium will be granted with the
non-refundable payment of $5.00 USD or more. This is a limited non-transferable
license. Transferring the service to another account does not transfer the
license and the original purchaser remains the license holder, and is therefore
responsible for making sure the account this license is associated with abides
by this agreement. Each license may not be associated with or used by more than
one account at any given moment. Either of these licenses may be revoked upon
breach of this agreement or as reasonably seen fit by the developers of Quickplay
and Quickplay Premium.

### 4. Restrictions
You may not (a) attempt to decompile, reverse engineer, or decrypt the provided
(compiled) software. Source code for Quickplay is available on the Quickplay
Github. (b) attempt to make a profit off of Quickplay, Quickplay Premium, or any
portion of it that is not within the scope of this software without explicit
written permission from the developers of Quickplay and Quickplay Premium. (c)
attempt to bypass any "pay-walls" that exist within Quickplay or Quickplay Premium.
(d) use the software in any way to directly or indirectly create a substitute or
competition to the software granted by this license or any other software or services
created by the developers of Quickplay or Quickplay Premium. (e) use the software
maliciously or in a way that would violate relevant laws or Hypixel Network rules.
(f) use the software, API, or interfaces in a way that they are not intended to be
used without explicit written permission from the developers of Quickplay and
Quickplay Premium.

### 5. Redistribution
You may redistribute exact copies of Quickplay and Quickplay Premium, provided you
clearly publish the relevant copyright information, this license, and do not claim
the software as your own.

You may not redistribute heavily modified versions of this program or sections of
this programs code (snippets) that serve the same purpose of the original software
without explicit written permission from the developers of Quickplay and Quickplay
Premium. Upon approval, all modifications must be clearly outlined and copyrights
and licensing rules retained. If your software does not serve as an alternative to
the original software or any other software or services created by the developers
of Quickplay or Quickplay Premium, then explicit written permission is unnecessary.

### 6. Termination of License
Failure to comply with points outlined in this license may result in an automatic
disabling of the software. You may terminate this agreement by ceasing all use of
this software and any relevant modifications or snippets. Developers of Quickplay
and Quickplay Premium reserve the right to terminate this agreement and disable
your software without notice and for any reasonable reason if deemed necessary.
